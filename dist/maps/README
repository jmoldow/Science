In commit eb0e0a2de3 and earlier, you could run the game with any map
you wanted. The map was loaded from a text file input, using the
conversions described below. The map loaded by default in the current
version of the game is defined in ./building.txt.

The map file must be an ASCII text file with the same number of ASCII
characters on each line, with a Linux-style newline terminating each
line. A path to a background image (which will pan with the
map itself during gameplay) can be provided as an optional, special
first line of the text file. The path can either be absolute, or
relative to the directory that science.py is located in.

Each of the following ASCII characters gets mapped to a 32 x 32 pixel
object during gameplay.

p - platform (rendered transparent (used if the platforms are drawn
into background image))
- - platform (rendered with an image)
f - fire!
* - beaker of science!
^ - stalagmite
V - stalactite
C - initial character position (required)
W - level exit (required)


Sharks are represented by a 2x2 group of ASCII characters:
Shark Facing Right              Shark Facing Left
oo                              oo
os                              so

Any other characters are treated as open spaces, and aren't rendered
into interactable objects.
