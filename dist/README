Known Defects:
 * Collision detection between the playable character and the platforms
 doesn't always work correctly. It is possible to phase through one or
 more blocks, and even to become stuck inside them.
 * Game can run slowly at times, depending on the machine and on how
 much memory is currently being used. This is because we took the naive
 approach to rendering sprites and detecting collisions. Future
 improvements might be made by using the DirtySprite class, not
 rendering objects that appear off-screen, and being smarter about
 collision detection.
