Dependencies:
 * Python 2.7 <http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/>
 * Pygame 1.9 <http://pygame.org/download.shtml>

Known Defects:
 * Collision detection between the playable character and the platforms
 doesn't always work correctly. It is possible to phase through one or
 more blocks, and even to become stuck inside them.
 * Game can run slowly at times, depending on the machine and on how
 much memory is currently being used. This is because we took the naive
 approach to rendering sprites and detecting collisions. Future
 improvements might be made by using the DirtySprite class, not
 rendering objects that appear off-screen, and being smarter about
 collision detection.

Loading Your Own Maps:
In commit eb0e0a2de3 and earlier, you could load different maps with
$ python science.py --file=<filename>
where <filename> is a text file containing a valid map definition (see
maps/README for more information on valid map definitions). The map
used by the current version of the game is loaded from
maps/building.txt. The ability to load any valid map was removed in
commit 501ac342f3 so that we could compile the code to a single Windows
executable.

License and Copywrite Information:
This game is free and open source. Anyone may view, download, and
modify the code. We would appreciate it if you contacted us before
doing so, but this is not required. Please attribute us, as well as
